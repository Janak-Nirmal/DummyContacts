DummyContacts
=============

DummyContacts is an application that allows you to add Contacts to AddressBook and can be handy tool for 
all iOS devices as well as simulators.

Reason for necessity of this application, recently came across the situation where need to manipulate AddressBook 
with multiple records. So either enter records manually in simulator or find some alternative for the situation.

So finally I ended up writing this small Project which will help to add/remove multiple contacts at a time to/from 
AddressBook without too much efforts.

It will add 100 random records to simulator along with photo.
